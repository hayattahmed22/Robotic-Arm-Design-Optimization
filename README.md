# Robotic Arm Design Optimization Project

## Overview
This project is part of the Johnson & Johnson MedTech Virtual Experience. It focuses on optimizing a surgical robotic arm to improve its responsiveness, durability, and precision.

## Problem Statement
- **Actuator Strain:** The robotic arm's actuators were under excessive mechanical strain, reducing precision and risking mechanical failure.
- **Sensor Misalignment:** Misaligned sensors caused delays and inaccuracies in real-time feedback, compromising surgical safety.

## Proposed Modifications
1. **Upgrade Actuators & Redistribute Load:**
   - Enhance joint load distribution and integrate higher-capacity actuators to reduce strain.
2. **Recalibrate and Realign Sensors:**
   - Improve sensor placement and calibration for more accurate real-time feedback.

## Simulation Results
- **Initial Metrics:**
  - Response Time: 0.20 seconds
  - Durability Score: 75

- **Post-Optimization Metrics:**
  - Response Time: 0.17 seconds
  - Durability Score: 86.25

These improvements demonstrate enhanced performance and longer operational lifespan.


## Expected Outcomes
- Improved responsiveness and precision.
- Enhanced reliability during critical procedures.
- Increased system durability and reduced maintenance needs.

## Files Included
- ðŸ“„ **Design_Proposal.docx:** Full written proposal document.
- ðŸ“Š **Simulation_Notebook.ipynb:** Python notebook used for performance simulation.
- ðŸ–¼ **images/:** Visual examples with before and after annotations.
